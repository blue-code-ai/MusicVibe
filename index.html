Ghum be hisaab the
Alag he wafa ke zaabte
Alag he hain agar manzilein to kyun na alag he rakhein hum raastay
Kyun na aaj se
Mita dein ye kismat hum haath se
Aur zehen azaad ho yaad se
Ham mit jayen jaa milein khaak se
Tere sheher bhi aye par safar se khatam na huay ye faaslay
Zakham bharen na baray be-reham se pesh aye hain haadsay
Baat se baat nikali ke tere dil pe lag jaye meri baat koi
Tu toot'tay taaro pe mange mujhе tujhe mayasar ho esi raat koi
I've been working a lot
Likhna nahi chhorta likhna he tod hai
Biktе hain ye gaane lakho main
Kya ye sab paise ka shor hai?
Kal sath na honge par yaad to hogi or bolo na zindagi kya hai
Yaadon ki maala ha yaadon ke ilawa kabhi kuch baaki raha hai
Kisi ne kya khoob kaha ha tere darmiyan bas tu he khada hai
Jhukao zaroori hai
Usse zaahir hota hai ke tu he bada hai
Jisse gaye hue khudse zamana hua woh tum main bhatakta hai
Mein khud nahi hun ye koi or hai mujhme jo tumko tarasta hai
Wujood ek tamasha tha hum jo dekhte the woh bhi ek tamasha hai
Hai mere dil ki guzarish ke mujhe mat choro ye jaan ka takaza hai
Ham zindagi dhoondte dhoondte maut ke muh main he jaatay rahay
Par hum thehray kalakaar
Khoj main bhi gun'gunatay rahay
Ao na
Ke tum he to ho jeenay ki wajah
Ke bethay bethay kr he dee subha
Na tu aya na he tera hai pata
Hmmm
Sahiba
Mein lene aya hu teri khabar
Tu dekh le jo ab meri taraf
To ho khatam meri bhi ye saza
Hmmm
Tum Meri yaadon main saath ho
Tum jaakay bhi mere paas ho
Tumhare he dum se zinda
Mar gaya jo tumse fursat ho
Tum meri kitabon ki tarha ho
Tum saamne ho lekin band ho
Ye dil kyun irado ke jesa nahi
Ke tootay nahi abhi tak woh
Mene jo chaha wo paya hai
Hunar se ghar bhi chalaya ha
Umer se farak nahi padta
Bada wo hai jisne bankay dikhaya hai
Music haram wo bolay
Phir mere uppar kis khuda ka saya hai?
Ghadi naraaz
Wo khadi naraaz ke
Music pe kyun itna time lagaya hai?
Khuwaab to khuwaab hain
Unka poora hona koi zaroori to nahi hai
Khuwaish tou khuwaish hai
Aakhir Zindagi bhi koi majboori to nahi hai
Mujhe ghum de sog de leja ye dil beshak isse tod de
Woh muhabbat he kya jo tum chhor aye
Woh muhabbat tou nahi agar chhor gaye
Tum he guroor thi
Tum main he noor tha
Tum bhi bezaar thi
Mein bhi majboor tha
Ye bhi ek dor hai
Woh bhi ek dor tha
Ye teri khamoshi tou kya wo shor tha
Jisse tu mili wo koi or tha
Par apna milna bhi ab moujza
Mein tou gaano main zindagi gaata hu
Kya pata tumhein pasand ho konsa
Ao na
Ke tum he to ho jeenay ki wajah
Ke bethay bethay kr he dee subha
Na tu aya na he tera hai pata
Hmmm
Sahiba
Mein lene aya hu teri khabar
Tu dekh le jo ab meri taraf
To ho khatam meri bhi ye saza
Hmmm</pre>

Psst, I see dead people
(Mustard on the beat, hoe)
Ayy, Mustard on the beat, hoe
Deebo, any rap nigga, he a free throw
Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, "Breathe, bro"
Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
Walk him down, whole time I know he got some hoe in him
Pole on him, extort shit, bully, Death Row on him
Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
And PARTY at the party, playin' with his nose now
And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff
Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?
Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A-Minor
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?
I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga
Did Cole fouI, I don't know why you still pretendin'
What is the owl? Bird niggas and bird bitches, go
The audience not dumb
Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch
And you Malibu most wanted
Ain't no law, boy, you ballboy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
What OVO for? The "Other Vaginal Option"? Pussy
Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
Might write this for the docket, tell the pop star, "Quit hidin'"
Fuck a caption, want action, no accident, and I'm hands-on
He fuck around, get polished
Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena
And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch
I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'
Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy
Sweet Chin Music, and I won't pass the aux, ayy
How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy
One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy
Devil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy
Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy
Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy
City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' town folk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club (ayy, what?)
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (what?)
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (ayy, what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (what?)
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
The family matter, and the truth of the matter
It was God's plan to show y'all the liar
Mm
Mm-mm
He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (mm)
He a fan, he a fan, he a-
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Let me hear you say, "OV-hoe" (OV-hoe)
Say, "OV-hoe" (OV-hoe)
Then step this way, step that way
Then step this way, step that way
Are you my friend?
Are we locked in?
Then step this way, step that way
Then step this way, step that way</pre>

Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Wait a minute (uh), get it how you live it (uh)
Ten toes in when we standin' on business
I'm a big stepper, underground methods
Top-notch hoes get the most, not the lesser (most, not the lesser)
Straight terror, product of your errors
Pushin' culture, baby, got that product you can't measure (product you can't measure)
Trendsetter, the one who gets her wetter
Swervin' while I'm bumpin' Project Pat
Yeah, rollin' through the city with the big dawgs
Fuck the laws, lawyer with me, we ain't gotta call
Celly on silent but the product end up hella loud
That's how you make the money pile for everyone involved
And if you don't deserve a cut then we gon' cut 'em off (cut 'em off)
My barber got me lookin' proper every single time
Fresh fade gettin' faded on that top grade
You ain't walkin' out alive smokin' what we on
And you know I gotta pour it for the ones who gone (gone)
R.I.P. it's in your memory we carry on
When I die they will not bury me, not what I want
Burn my body, pour my ashes in a river y'all
That's how we knowin' that the flow about to carry on
See immortality's a fallacy, I prove 'em wrong
The Sourthern family gon' carry me to way beyond
Anything you've ever known, anything you've done
They ask me, "How you be like this? (What?)
How you live like this? (What? What? What?)"
Why you woried 'bout it ho? Get up off my dick (get up off my dick)
Get up out the way (get up out the way)
What you think this is? (What you think this is?)
We ain't worried 'bout it ho, watch me skrrt the whip
They ask me, "How you get like this? (What? What?)
How you live like this? (What? What?)"
Why you woried 'bout it ho? Get up off my dick (get up off my dick)
Get up out the way (get up out the way)
What you think this is? (What you think this is?)
We ain't worried 'bout it ho, watch me skrrt the whip
Yeah, yeah, swervin', movin' to the money like it's urgent
Hands on guy so I'm in it like a surgeon (like a surgeon)
Uh, the skin colour like the bourbon
A worldwide sign that we face close curtains (close curtains)
Out here yo, nothing's ever certain
Only thing that's promised is that promises are broken (promises are broken)
Yeah, so we findin' ways to cope then
Only thing I'm breakin' is her back with the motions (woo)
Yeah, baby girl bring out the goodies
Snuck it in inside her hoodie, now we turnin' up to Boogie (yeah)
In school I used to fight the bullies, now I'm fightin' with the law
Guess some things don't leave you fully (yessir)
They try and push me then they try and pull me
Bet I will not budge, if you doubt it then just call my bookie
And my bookie takin' bets
Prophesize a profit when you know what's comin' next, like ooh
Yeah, baby girl, bring out the goodies
Snuck it in inside her hoodie, now we turnin' up to Boogie (yeah)
In school I used to fight the bullies, now I'm fightin' with the law
Guess some things don't leave you fully

And my bookie takin' bets
Prophesize a profit when you know what's comin' next, like uh
Money on my mind, we gon' run it up
See what you gon' find, baby push your luck

Going Out Tonight
Changes Into Something Red
Her Mother Doesn't Like That Kind Of Dress
Everything She Never Had She's Showing Off

Driving Too Fast
Moon Is Breaking Through Her Hair
She's Heading For Something
That She Won't Forget
Having No Regrets Is All
That She Really Wants

We're Only Getting Older, Baby
And I've Been Thinking About It Lately
Does It Ever Drive You Crazy
Just How Fast The Night Changes?
Everything That You've Ever Dreamed Of
Disappearing When You Wake Up
But There's Nothing To Be Afraid Of
Even When The Night Changes
It Will Never Change Me And You

Chasing It Tonight,
Doubts Are Running 'round Her Head
He's Waiting, Hides Behind A Cigarette
Heart Is Beating Loud,
And She Doesn't Want It To Stop

Moving Too Fast
Moon Is Lighting Up Her Skin
She's Falling, Doesn't Even Know It Yet
Having No Regrets Is All That She Really Wants

We're Only Getting Older, Baby
And I've Been Thinking About It Lately
Does It Ever Drive You Crazy
Just How Fast The Night Changes?
Everything That You've Ever Dreamed Of
Disappearing When You Wake Up
But There's Nothing To Be Afraid Of
Even When The Night Changes
It Will Never Change Me And You

Going Out Tonight
Changes Into Something Red
Her Mother Doesn't Like That Kind Of Dress
Reminds Her Of The Missing Piece
Of Innocence She Lost

We're Only Getting Older, Baby
And I've Been Thinking About It Lately
Does It Ever Drive You Crazy
Just How Fast The Night Changes?
Everything That You've Ever Dreamed Of
Disappearing When You Wake Up
But There's Nothing To Be Afraid Of
Even When The Night Changes
It Will Never Change, Baby
It Will Never Change, Baby
It Will Never Change Me And You</pre>

City of stars
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars
There's so much that i can't see
Who knows?
I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you
That now our dreams
They've finally come true

City of stars
Just one thing everybody wants
There in the bars
And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
It's love
Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else
A rush
A glance
A touch
A dance

To look in somebody's eyes
To light up the skies
To open the world and send them reeling
A voice that says, I'll be here
And you'll be alright
I don't care if I know
Just where I will go
'Cause all that I need's this crazy feeling
A rat-tat-tat on my heart…

Think I want it to stay
City of stars
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars
You never shined so brightly</pre>

Saanson main tu hi basi
Dekha na tujhsa hasi
Tere bina na main jaun kahin
Tujhsa na jana koi

Hai kaafi dur par kaafi kareeb
Mohobat main jaana hum thodi shareef
Main mangu dua ki tu ho mere paas
Aankhon ka noor ho bs mere naseeb

Kyu kar gyi pagal tu
Main tere khyaalon main hoon
Ye jaana to kaafi sukoon mila mujhe
Main teri yaadon main hun

Tu kar gyi bekaabu
Main tere khyaalon main hun
Ye jaana to kaafi sukoon mila mujhe
Main teri yaadon main hun

Ankhein teri diamonds tu unse bhi keemti
Sun mere gaana baby if you wanna feel me
Tune pucha tha kyu krte ho psnd
Baby imma bad broken boy and you just heal me

Tha mein kaafi cold tujhse feelings judi kaafi
You're the only one jisse mangta main maafi
Pyaar karunga main tujhse jaana tere baad bhi
Thodi si likhi hai par meri likhi tere saath hi

Baategi saare pal honge wo khush numa
Main darta nhi hun par i don't wanna loose you haan
Dil tha ye pathar par sach main btaun
Tere aane ke baad dil mein mere bohot kuch hua

Tujhse milkr rehne lga hun kaafi ajeeb
You're mah lucky charm baby you're mah zehnaseeb
Kaafi zyada ziddi tha main kaafi zyada dheeth
Par maan ne laga hun coz you are just like me

Saanson main tu hi basi
Dekha na tujhsa hasi
Tere bina na main jaun kahin
Tujhsa na jana koi

Hai kaafi dur par kaafi kareeb
Mohobat main jaana hum thodi shareef
Main mangu dua ki tu ho mere paas
Aankhon ka noor ho bs mere naseeb

Kyu kar gyi pagal tu
Main tere khyaalon main hoon
Ye jaana to kaafi sukoon mila mujhe
Main teri yaadon main hun

Tu kar gyi bekaabu
Main tere khyaalon main hun
Ye jaana to kaafi sukoon mila mujhe
Main teri yaadon main hun

Saath ni tu karun main kya ab
Haath ye dun kare kyu naa ab
Rutha dil ise manaa ab
De wafa thodi hayaa ab

Pehle pyaar phir krein baat hum
Inn dilon ko laade paas ab
Dur krein dono hi ye gumm
Janti tu meri hai khaas ab

Faasle hata kyu tu ye deri sazaa
Aankhein hai numm uski hai tu hi wajah
Tujhse milun karke bahane hazar
Kyu tu darti hai pagal ishi mein hai mazaa

Dil ko karaar bas chahe tera ye pyaar
Ginti ke pal chahe tu deja udhaar
Utne mein dil khush pyaar de beshumaar
Chal chodke ye subh chalein jahan ke paar</pre>

Maybe I was wrong and you were right
But I don't really wanna have this fight
I just wanna feel like I belong
And every time my heart swings back to you
You are my morning and my truth
And all that I can do is sing this song
It ain't that long, mm
And nothing says "I love you" like your eyes
Fill my lips with carbon dioxide
I just wanna feel like I deserve you
'Cause you deserve me
Baby, it's the way that you can see
What I miss and what I can never be
I just wanna feel like I deserve you
'Cause you deserve me
Maybe you were wrong and I was right
I don't care, won't you stay another night?
I just need some time to be myself
I couldn't say "I need you" on that night
When you left and I lost all track of time
I just want you close so I can feel you
Can you feel me? Mmm
And nothing says "I love you" like the words
That were never said, but could be heard
If only there was peace around us, baby
You would hear me
And maybe it's the way that lovers do
I just want for me what I want for you
Only with the sun above us maybe
You would see me
And even if you leave, I may be fine
'Cause my heart, it has its own design
And even if you never see it, baby
You're all that I need
Maybe it's the silence in your eyes
Maybe it's the lilac when you're shy
Maybe it's the mystery of your love
All I need is a sign from the stars above
Maybe it's the way that you breathe in me
Maybe it's the man that you see in me
Maybe it's the fragrance of your hair
Yeah, I just wanna kiss you when you're there
I just want you all around me, baby
Can we make that happen, please</pre>

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep
I don't wanna pass away
I've been thinking of our future 'Cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I've been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hoping you'll find someone else
'Cause, yeah, we're still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it off this bed
I hope I go to heaven, so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending
Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed, yeah
And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
Yeah, I'm happy that you're here with me
I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos while walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sang me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays went to church, on Mondays watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me
Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed</pre>

Ay, Ay, Ay
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Ay, Ay
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

Needless to say, I'm keeping her in check
She was all bad-bad, nevertheless
Calling it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck

Needless to say, I'm keeping her in check
She was all bad-bad, nevertheless
Calling it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck

Thinking in a bad way, losing your grip
Screaming at my face, baby don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Looking at you sideways, party on tilt

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise
And I'm not tryna lose

Then you're left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
I think your love would be too

Then you're left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower

Every time I'm leaving on you
You don't make it easy, no no
Wish I could be there for you
Give me a reason to go

Every time I'm walking out 
I can hear you telling me to turn around 
Fighting for my trust and you won't back down
Even if we gotta risk it all right now

I know you're scared of the unknown
You don't wanna be alone
I know I always come and go 
But it's out of my control

Then you're left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
I think your love would be too

Then you're left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower

Then you're left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower</pre>

Ask me why my heart's inside my throat
I've never been in love, I've been alone
Feel like I've been living life asleep
Love so strong it makes me feel so weak
Are you lonely? (Are you lonely?)
Our fingers dancing when they meet
You seem so lonely (are you lonely?)
I'll be the only dream you seek
So if you're lonely, no need to show me
If you're lonely, come be lonely with me
Lonely (are you lonely?)
Passion is crashing as we speak
You seem so lonely (are you lonely?)
You're the ground my feet won't reach
So if you're lonely, darling you're glowing
If you're lonely, come be lonely with me
Underneath the pale moonlight
Dreaming of a circus life
Carousels and Ferris heights
I'll be yours if you'll be mine
'Cause I'm lonely, I'm so lonely
If you hold me, I'll be your only
Are you lonely? (Are you lonely?)
Our fingers dancing when they meet
You seem so lonely (are you lonely?)
I'll be the only dream you seek
So if you're lonely, no need to show me
If you're lonely, come be lonely with me
Are you lonely?
Passion is crashing as we speak
You seem so lonely
You're the ground my feet won't reach
So if you're lonely
Darling, you're glowing
If you're lonely, come be lonely with me</pre>

Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, "Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather"
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better
Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh, my love, can't you see that you're on my mind?
Don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind?
So goodbye
She said, "It's not now or never
Wait ten years, we'll be together"
I said, "Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever"
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever
Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind?
I was doin' fine without you
'Til I saw your face, now I can't erase
Givin' in to all his bullshit
Is this what you want? is this who you are?
I was doin' fine without you
'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine
Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you
Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"</pre>
